# gps_file_extraction
files for extracting data from gps text files

#### 2023 October 10th

Primarily used for splitting and extracting data from log files created by https://github.com/barbeau/gpstest

I don't expect these files to be completely optimized, but they should be functional. 

Feel free to use and improve.
